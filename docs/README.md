# How to build the documentation

The documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). To build the html files, execute

```shell   
make html
```

Some packages are required to build the documentation. See the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file for the 
list of required packages.
