Nopayloaddb Documentation
===================================

**Nopayloaddb** is a reference implementation of a **Conditions Database (CDB)** for High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments, developed by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF). It provides a robust, scalable RESTful API for managing time-dependent calibration and configuration data.

What is Nopayloaddb?
====================

Nopayloaddb serves as a **conditions database service** designed to handle the complex requirements of HEP experiments:

üîß **Payload Management**
   Store and retrieve time-dependent calibration data, alignment parameters, and configuration settings

üìä **Version Control**
   Manage different versions of conditions data with proper validity intervals (IOVs)

üè∑Ô∏è **Global Tags**  
   Organize consistent sets of conditions for specific processing campaigns or data-taking periods

üîÑ **Read/Write Splitting**
   Scalable architecture with support for read replicas and database load balancing

üåê **RESTful API**
   Clean, well-documented HTTP API for easy integration with experiment frameworks

Key Features
============

‚ú® **Ready to Adopt**
   - Docker containerization for easy deployment
   - PostgreSQL backend with connection pooling
   - Kubernetes and OpenShift deployment templates

üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Performance**
   - JWT and token-based authentication

   - Django ORM with custom database routing
   - RESTful API built with Django REST Framework
   - Documentation and examples

Core Concepts
=============

Understanding these key concepts will help you work effectively with Nopayloaddb:

**Payloads**
   The actual conditions data (e.g., calibration constants, alignment parameters) stored as references to external files or binary data.

**Payload Types**
   Categories that define the structure or type of payload data (e.g., 'BeamSpot', 'SiPixelQuality', 'CEMC_Thresh').

**Interval of Validity (IOV)**
   The time range, run number range, or other validity dimension for which a specific payload is valid.

**Global Tags**
   Named collections of specific payload IOVs that represent a consistent set of conditions for a particular processing campaign or data-taking period.

**Payload Lists**
   Intermediate entities that link Global Tags to Payload Types, serving as containers for related payload versions.

       class B api
       class C database
       class D storage


The system follows a **metadata-only** approach where the database stores references to payload files rather than the files themselves, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets.
