# Nopayloaddb

The nopayloaddb project works as an implementation of the Conditions Database reference for the [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/). It provides a RESTful API for managing payloads, global tags, payload types, and associated data. The API allows clients to perform CRUD operations on these resources.

## Current release 

Current release tag is 0.0.6

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch 0.0.6 https://github.com/BNLNPPS/nopayloaddb /nopayloaddb
```

This release will be deployed at Production and Tests instances when OKD back

Production:
```
http://nopayloaddb-nopayloaddb.apps.sdcc.bnl.gov
```

Test:
```
http://npdb-test-test.apps.sdcc.bnl.gov
```

Example of read call to get last Payload for Global tag "sPHENIX_ExampleGT_24" and IOV=999999:
```

## How to start the services

The npdb web app can be built and started by using `docker compose` within the
cloned repository:

```shell
docker compose up --build
```

This option may be preferred for local development and tests. In order to stop
the services run the following command:

```shell
docker compose down
```
In Docker Compose V1 one may need to use `docker-compose`; see details on
[migrating to Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/)

The database and web services can be also started individually. The following
commands are essentially equivalent to the above procedure with `docker compose`
and are shown here for the reference:

```shell
docker run --rm --env-file=.env --detach --name=pg --hostname=db -p 5432:5432 -v $PWD/db/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
docker run --rm --env-file=.env          --name=wa --link=pg -it -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/plexoos/npdb:latest
```

During the development one may need to start over with empty DB tables. An easy
way to recreate the database tables is to remove the data directory:

```shell
rm -fr db/data
```

In order to deploy the npdb service on a Red Hat OpenShift (OKD) cluster we
recommend using the template provided in this repository. First, login into OKD:

```shell
oc login
```

Then create a new project if it does not exist yet:

```shell
oc new-project npps
```

Finally, register the new npdb template and start the web app from it:

```shell
oc create -f npdb_openshift_template.yaml
oc new-app --template=npdb
```
